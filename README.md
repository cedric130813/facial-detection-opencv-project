### openCV Project (face detection)
<hr>

This is an [openCV project](https://opencv.org/) using [Haar Cascade Frontal Face](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades). Haar Cascade has been around for quite a number of years yet it is a very powerful and useful tool when it comes to face detection using openCV.

For this demo, I used the images of the K-pop group ITZY https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itzy to identify the group members
